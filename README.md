## Local development

### Preparation

1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
1. Install Node (version in `.nvmrc`)
1. Install and activate all recomended `VSCode` extensions
1. Enable [Take Over Mode](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#volar-takeover-mode):
    - `Ctrl + Shift + P` (macOS: `Cmd + Shift + P`).
    - Type `built` and select `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions`.
    - Type `typescript` in the extension search box (do not remove `@builtin` prefix).
    - Click the little gear icon of `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, and select `Disable (Workspace)`.
1. Install `yarn`:
    ```shell
    npm install --global yarn
    ```
1. Install all packages
    ```shell
    yarn
    ```
1. Run `yarn typecheck` for type checking
1. Run `yarn lint` for linting

Choose one of `.env` presets. HMR working in all modes.

> To use `Mode 1` and `Mode 2`, a raised container from [this repo](https://github.com/baikov/tpl-traefik) with Traefik is required. Because an external network to which frontend and backend containers are connected is created in Traefik compose.

### Mode 0: As separate dev server on custom port

1. No need for a Traefik container
1. Set `uniqe` project name
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=uniqe_name
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 0` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 0: As separate dev server on custom port
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml
    DOMAIN=localhost
    NUXT_DOCKER_PORT=3018  # custom port
    HMR_DOCKER_PORT=24678
    ```
1. Run `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 1: As dev server behind the Traefik with http

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 1`
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 1` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 1: As dev server behind the Traefik with http
    # For Windows users: use `;` (semicolon) as separator - local.yml;local.traefik.yml
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml:local.traefik.yml
    DOMAIN=localhost  # or another aliace for 127.0.0.1 declared in etc/hosts, but same as DOMAIN in Traefik .env!
    ```
1. Run Traefik container, then run Nuxt container with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 2: As dev server behind the Traefik + SSL and custom domain

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 2`
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 2` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 2: As dev server behind the Traefik + SSL and custom domain
    # For Windows users: use `;` (semicolon) as separator - local.yml;local.traefik.yml;local.traefik.ssl.yml
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml:local.traefik.yml:local.traefik.ssl.yml
    DOMAIN=tpl.local  # same as DOMAIN in Traefik .env!
    ```
1. Run Traefik container, then run Nuxt container with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

## Deploy to production

> Using this modes assumes that the `your-domain.com` is already bound to your server (`A` records are configured) and Traefik container raised in production mode

### Mode 3: SSR (Universal rendering) with Node.js server

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 3` on prod server
1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` on prod server
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 3` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 3: For production with SSR
    COMPOSE_FILE=production.yml
    DOMAIN=your-domain.com
    ```
1. Run container with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 4: SPA with Nginx

## Contributing

I made this template for myself, but it's awesom if it helps someone else. The settings are far from ideal, so fell free to make a pull request.
